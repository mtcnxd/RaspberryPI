# GPIO Stream

GPIO Stream allows you to pipe around inputs and outputs on the Raspberry Pi using the
[node.js stream API](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_api_for_stream_consumers).
Why is this a good thing? Node streams allow you to pipe output from one stream to the
input of another stream, just like [unix pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29).
Streams make it easy to combine small chunks of code into complex systems with very little effort.

## Installing

    npm install gpio-stream

## Accessing GPIO without running scripts as root

The Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins require you run scripts as the root user to access them.
Because it's not safe to run scripts as the root user, we can install
[quick2wire-gpio-admin](https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-gpio-admin) to avoid this.

Run this on your Raspberry Pi:

```
git clone git://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-gpio-admin.git ~/quick2wire-gpio-admin && cd ~/quick2wire-gpio-admin
make
sudo make install
sudo adduser $USER gpio
```

In the examples, we are going to use pins 17 & 18, so let's export them so your user can access them.

```
gpio-admin export 17
gpio-admin export 18
```

## A Simple Example

Let's say we want to view the state of the button from our SSH connection. Since *stdout* is
a writable stream, we can pipe the output of the button directly to *stdout*.

![led gif](https://uniontownlabs.org/images/gpio_stream/stdout.gif)

```js
var GpioStream = require('gpio-stream'),
    button = GpioStream.readable(17);

// pipe the button presses to stdout
button.pipe(process.stdout);
```

## Next Steps

Now let's try a simple example of how to pipe the output of a button to an LED.

![led gif](https://uniontownlabs.org/images/gpio_stream/led.gif)

```js
var GpioStream = require('gpio-stream'),
    button = GpioStream.readable(17),
    led = GpioStream.writable(18);

// pipe the button presses to the LED
button.pipe(led);
```

## Going Further

What else can we do with this? How about streaming the button presses to a LED & to a web browser?
Since the node.js HTTP server response is a writable stream, we can pipe the button presses to the LED,
and then to the HTTP response object. Your browser can receive the presses on the fly using
[chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding). All of that
with ~10 lines of code!

![browser gif](https://uniontownlabs.org/images/gpio_stream/browser.gif)

```js
var GpioStream = require('gpio-stream'),
    http = require('http'),
    button = GpioStream.readable(17),
    led = GpioStream.writable(18);

var stream = button.pipe(led);

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  res.write('<pre>logging button presses:\n');
  stream.pipe(res);
}).listen(8080);
```
